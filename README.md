mobile-gamepad-control
=============

Connect a mobile device and desktop to localhost and control the movement of a square on the desktop screen from the mobile device.

- To run the program, use `$ python server.py`
- The web socket address may need to be modified to match your local ip address in gamepad.js for the connection to work.

**Note:** Only a Nexus 5 Android device and iPad Mini has been tested for mobile and Linux for desktop, others are currently not supported.

Currently being developed and updated when I can find the time ;)
